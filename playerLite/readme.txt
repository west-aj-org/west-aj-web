III. Requirements
	
    1.	This player is intended only for online use with broadband connections.
	Slow connections may suffer of stuttering and long loading times.

    2.  A CPU capabable of video playback for the chosen definition.

    3.  Hosting with streaming support and a FTP client to upload files in there.


IV. How to Use

    1.  Unpak everything into your directory.

    2.  Prepare your FLV video and thumbnail. Keep the same width and height
	for both files.
		
	NOTE: thumbnail preview supports jpg and swf files.

    3.  Open the example "index.html" file with an html editor.

    4.	Locate the javascript between the head tags and replace the flashvars
	with your parameters. You must specify width, height, absolute path of
	both FLV and thumbnail files as well if the video should autoplay or not
	by setting it to "true" or "false".
	
	NOTE: if you leave the thumbnail path empty, like this "", the player
	will seek the first frame of the video and show it as preview. By setting
	autoplay to true no preview will be shown.

    5.	Copy the whole edited javascript and paste it into your destination document
	between the head tags. Remember to include also "swfobject.js" as shown in 
	the example.

    6.  Now write down a div with id "playerLite", like this: <div id="playerLite"></div>
	
	This div will display the video player and you can edit its parameters with
	your custom style sheet. Place the alternative content inside these div for 
	those who don't have the requested version of flash player installed.

    	NOTE: you can place this div anywhere you want, just put it inside the body tag.

    7.  Save, publish and test your document.
