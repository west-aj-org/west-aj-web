				<p>Welcome to the Hickory House website. On this site you will find information on all the things that are important to the house. There is a section for  Events as well as a section with "Information" about hickory house and what we stand for. If you want to see the current house council and some information on them, you can find that on the "About Us" page, and if you wish to look at our roots you can look at the "Ancestor's" page which has information on the founding members of the council and every person who has sat on the council since its creation. If you wish to connect with your fellow Hickory members then you can go to our facebook page which is our acting forum for all issues you wish to discuss. If you have any questions or comments about the website, you may contact the Webmaster who's information can be found in the "Contact Us" page </p>
